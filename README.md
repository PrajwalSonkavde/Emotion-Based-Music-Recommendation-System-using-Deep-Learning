# Emotion-Based-Music-Recommendation-System-using-Deep-Learning
Tired of generic music recs? We built an AI system that recommends songs based on your REAL-TIME emotions!  Deep Learning analyzes your facial expressions. Haar Cascade detects &amp; tracks your face in real-time. Music selection adapts to your chosen language. Discover music that truly moves you.  #music #AI #deeplearning #emotions

## OBJECTIVE
–	Develop a real- time emotion recognition model using CNN for accurate and immediate emotion discovery
–	Make a real- time recommendation machine that suggests music which matchs our emotion’s
–	This system eliminates the manual effort of selecting songs and enhances the user's interaction with music in alignment with their emotions
–	Optimize the system by implementing Haar Cascade face detection to capture and pass detected faces to the model for accurate emotion prediction
–	Develop a user interface which recommends user interface real time 
–	Implement a language selector functionality in the HTML page to enable the system to play music based on the user's language preference.

## Algorithm Steps:
1.	Data Collection : Gather images from the 'TRAIN_DIR' and 'TEST_DIR' directories.
2.	Data Preprocessing : Perform preprocessing on images, including conversion to grayscale and normalization.
3.	Model Development : Construct a CNN model with multiple convolutional and dense layers.
4.	Model Training: Train the model using the training data.
5.	Model Testing : Evaluate the trained model's performance on the test data.
6.	Model Selection: Choose the best-performing model based on testing results.
7.	Develop User Interface : Build a user-friendly Flask app to serve as an interface for interacting with the trained model.
8.	Integration with Face Detection : Implement face detection during the prediction phase to identify and extract faces from input images. Pass these detected faces to the model for emotion prediction.
9.	Integration with Webcam : Incorporate webcam functionality into the user interface for real-time predictions.
10.	Optimization for Accuracy : Fine-tune the model , user interface and add other techniques to optimize for accurate emotion prediction.
11.	Results : Analyze and interpret the results, ensuring the system provides reliable and effective emotion predictions in real-time.
